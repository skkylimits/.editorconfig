Don't forget to install [EditorConfig.EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

## Usage

It's important to have the extension installed for your editor to enforce the rulesets.

However that's not enough. Ideally you have to add these to your .vscode/settings.json. Else there would be saving conflicts

## Install

```
install .editorconfig to your project
```
